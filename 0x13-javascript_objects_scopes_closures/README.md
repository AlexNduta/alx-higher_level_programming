# Classes in JS

## task 0:
An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
    Must use a classnotation for defining your class


## task 1:
A class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
    you must use the `class` notation for defining the class
    The constructor must take two arguments
    Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`
    Initialise the instance attribute `height` with the value `h`
## task 2:
A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
    You must use the class notation
    The constructor must take two arguments
    Initialize the intance attribute `width` with the value of `w`
    Initialise the instance attribute `height` with the vakue of `h`
    if `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a postive integer, create an empty object

## A class `rectangle` that defined a rectangle
    You must use the class notation to define your class
    The constructor must take two arguments `w` and `h`
    initialise width with w and height with h
    if w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive number, create an empty object
    Create an intance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character `X`
    create `rotate()` that exchanges the `width` and the `height`
    create an instance method `double()` that multiplies the `width` and the `height` of the rectangle by 2

## task 5
A class that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js
    You must use the `class` notation for defining your class and `extends`
    The constructor takes one argument; `size`
    The constructor of `Rectangle` must be called using `super()`
